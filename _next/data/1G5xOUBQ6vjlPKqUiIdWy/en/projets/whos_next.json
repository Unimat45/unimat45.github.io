{"pageProps":{"description_en":"Personally having difficulty remembering the birthdays of my acquaintances, I had the idea of creating this site to help me solve this problem. This web application allows these users to create an account, indicating their date of birth, and to join the groups to which they have been invited. The index of these groups shows the next person's birthday, indicating the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the next special day. Further down on the same page, a table showing the birthdays of all the people registered in this same group. This site is not currently online, as it is missing some finishing touches, but I hope it will be ready for the public soon!","title":"Who's Next ?","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/WhosNext.git","nbr_images":5,"slug":"whos_next"},"__N_SSG":true}
