{"pageProps":{"description_en":"This application has one specific purpose: to manage a Minecraft server remotely using the server's already integrated commands. Although this program seems very simplistic, the format used to transmit messages to the server makes the process more complicated. This program takes care of reading the command entered by the user, converting them to the correct format and communicating with the server through a TCP/IP connection. Similarly, when receiving a message from the server, the program decrypts the bytes and displays the character string in the console. Very practical for managing multiple servers.","title":"Rcon","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/Rcon.git","nbr_images":1,"slug":"rcon"},"__N_SSG":true}
