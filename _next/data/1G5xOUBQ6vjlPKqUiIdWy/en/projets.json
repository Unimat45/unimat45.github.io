On the first visit, you can see all the films and series available, classified by genre (Ex: Action, Comedy, etc.) each in their respective carousel. A search page is also available to easily find a video either by name or genre. The application also includes some user-friendly features, for example: A section to continue listening to a film that has not been finished, a button that appears towards the end of an episode to listen the next episode.","title":"Banana Streaming","link":"https://www.bananastreaming.ca","nbr_images":4,"slug":"banana_streaming"},{"description_en":"Practical for shooting games, this application draws a small crosshair in the center of your main screen in order to help with the precision of these games. Although this application is written in C#, it is only available on Windows machines, since it uses its API to create a window and draw inside it. The reticle can be adapted to different games: using a key combination, it is possible to change the location of the drawing in order to accommodate all games. A configuration file is also available to automate the placement of the reticle when launching an application. This file uses JSON format.","title":"Crosshair","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/Crosshair.git","nbr_images":3,"slug":"crosshair"},{"description_en":"A desktop application that takes care of saving your passwords securely, while having a simple and elegant graphical interface. The application includes a function to change the interface language, either to English or French, as well as the option to export passwords saved in JSON format as a backup and reimport this same file. The program allows the user to save a label (Ex.: Twitter, Facebook, etc.), a username or email, a way to quickly identify important information as well as a password which will be encrypted using a custom algorithm. This very application was written partly in JavaScript using the React framework, as well as in Rust with the Tauri framework.","title":"Password Patch","link":"https://pfk.ddns.net/files/password-patch_x64-setup.exe","nbr_images":2,"slug":"password_patch"},{"description_en":"Although the game of “pong” is one of the oldest commercialized video games, its charm and simplicity keep players’ attention. Several people have attempted to rebuild this interactive gaming icon, and many have added a touch of cosmetic customization to make the interface more attractive. This version remains more original to its source, but, on the other hand, offers the possibility of being played in a web browser or natively on a computer. Written in C++ and using the “SDL2” graphics library, you can use a compiler to convert this program into WebAssembly. Of course, you can always compile it in a more traditional way and play it as a desktop application.","title":"Pong","link":"/pong.html","nbr_images":1,"slug":"pong"},{"description_en":"Although not visually impressive, this application allows you to manage the data line of a computer's parallel port using a simple command. This comes in two parts: the server, the one that receives and processes the sent command, and the client, which, in this case, is a web application hosted only on a local network. Although the server is written in C, the client can be rebuilt in any programming language, since the connection to the server is made in UDP/IP. The commands were created to be intuitive and always follow this basis: STATUS LINE INSTRUCTION. For example, to turn on the third line, we would use “SET PIN 3 HIGH”. The use of this program can vary greatly from person to person, I personally use it to turn off my pool installer at night.","title":"Pport","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/pport.git","nbr_images":1,"slug":"pport"},{"description_en":"This application has one specific purpose: to manage a Minecraft server remotely using the server's already integrated commands. Although this program seems very simplistic, the format used to transmit messages to the server makes the process more complicated. This program takes care of reading the command entered by the user, converting them to the correct format and communicating with the server through a TCP/IP connection. Similarly, when receiving a message from the server, the program decrypts the bytes and displays the character string in the console. Very practical for managing multiple servers.","title":"Rcon","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/Rcon.git","nbr_images":1,"slug":"rcon"},{"description_en":"Personally having difficulty remembering the birthdays of my acquaintances, I had the idea of creating this site to help me solve this problem. This web application allows these users to create an account, indicating their date of birth, and to join the groups to which they have been invited. The index of these groups shows the next person's birthday, indicating the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until the next special day. Further down on the same page, a table showing the birthdays of all the people registered in this same group. This site is not currently online, as it is missing some finishing touches, but I hope it will be ready for the public soon!","title":"Who's Next ?","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/WhosNext.git","nbr_images":5,"slug":"whos_next"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
