Although this application is written in C#, it is only available on Windows machines, since it uses its API to create a window and draw inside it. The reticle can be adapted to different games: using a key combination, it is possible to change the location of the drawing in order to accommodate all games. A configuration file is also available to automate the placement of the reticle when launching an application. This file uses JSON format.","title":"Crosshair","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/Crosshair.git","nbr_images":3,"slug":"crosshair"},"__N_SSG":true}
