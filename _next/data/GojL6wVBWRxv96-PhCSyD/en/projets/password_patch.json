{"pageProps":{"description_en":"A desktop application that takes care of saving your passwords securely, while having a simple and elegant graphical interface. The application includes a function to change the interface language, either to English or French, as well as the option to export passwords saved in JSON format as a backup and reimport this same file. The program allows the user to save a label (Ex.: Twitter, Facebook, etc.), a username or email, a way to quickly identify important information as well as a password which will be encrypted using a custom algorithm. This very application was written partly in JavaScript using the React framework, as well as in Rust with the Tauri framework.","title":"Password Patch","link":"https://pfk.ddns.net/files/password-patch_x64-setup.exe","nbr_images":2,"slug":"password_patch"},"__N_SSG":true}
