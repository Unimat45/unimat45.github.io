{"pageProps":{"description_en":"Although not visually impressive, this application allows you to manage the data line of a computer's parallel port using a simple command. This comes in two parts: the server, the one that receives and processes the sent command, and the client, which, in this case, is a web application hosted only on a local network. Although the server is written in C, the client can be rebuilt in any programming language, since the connection to the server is made in UDP/IP. The commands were created to be intuitive and always follow this basis: STATUS LINE INSTRUCTION. For example, to turn on the third line, we would use “SET PIN 3 HIGH”. The use of this program can vary greatly from person to person, I personally use it to turn off my pool installer at night.","title":"Pport","link":"https://github.com/Unimat45/pport.git","nbr_images":1,"slug":"pport"},"__N_SSG":true}
